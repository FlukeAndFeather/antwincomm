Description: The Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem is highly
    productive, with large populations of commercially and ecologically
    important species including Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, Adélie
    penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, and crabeater seals Lobodon
    carcinophagus. The ecology of the peninsula is rapidly changing due to
    accelerating climate change and fishing pres- sure. Systematic
    ecosystem surveys have focused on austral spring and summer, leaving
    an information gap on winter ecosystem dynamics. Using data from 5
    consecutive ecosystem surveys, we quantified the composition and
    distribution of winter predator communities and investigated the
    physical and biological influences on community structure. Seabirds
    and marine mammals clustered into 3 communities: an ice-associated
    community represented by Adélie penguins and crabeater seals; a
    diverse marginal ice zone community dominated by fur seals and several
    species of seabirds including 3 petrels, kelp gulls Larus dominicanus,
    and Antarctic terns Sterna vittata; and an open water community
    consisting of southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides and 4 species of
    petrels. These communities were distributed along an environmental
    gradient ranging from ice-covered, cold, saline water to ice-free,
    warmer, and fresher water with greater chlorophyll concentrations.
    Predator communities were also associated with different communities
    of macrozooplankton: ice-associated predators with an extremely
    diverse assemblage of typically mesopelagic zooplankton; marginal ice
    zone predators with a community of large-bodied euphausiids (E.
    superba, E. crystallorophias); and open water predators with a
    community of small-bodied euphausiids (Thysanoessa macrura). Our
    synthesis of integrated winter predator and macrozooplankton
    communities relative to sea-ice concentration provides reference
    points for future ecosystem assessments within this rapidly changing
    region.
