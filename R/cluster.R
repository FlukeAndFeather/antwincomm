# From Dietrich et al. 2021:
# Abundance was log-transformed (log10(x + 1)) to minimize the influence of
# highly abundant taxa in subsequent multivariate analysis. To minimize the
# influence of rare taxa, taxa were excluded if they did not occur in at least
# 5% of the net hauls. [predators sighted near >=5% of stations]
# ...
# A Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix based on abundance
# ...
# Separate hierarchical agglomerative cluster analyses of taxa abundance were
# performed with the R package cluster
# ...
# Wardâ€™s minimum variance was selected as the linkage method due to having the
# highest agglomerative coefficient
# ...
# Indicator values were calculated for each taxa cluster combination based on
# formulas in Dufrene and Leg- endre (1997) and implemented in the R package
# labdsv
