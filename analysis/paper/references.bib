Logistic regression and an information-theoretic approach related the occurrence of Antarctic minke whales               Balaenoptera bonaerensis               (the most abundant species) to whether we were in open- or pack-ice-covered pelagic or neritic waters, in or out of the marginal ice zone (MIZ), and north or south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current southern boundary. Other variables included date and distance to the MIZ and shelfbreak front. Statistical analysis showed that the probability of sighting a minke, as well as killer whale---but not the case for an index to whale density---was related to the proximity of coastal polynyas in early autumn, switching offshore to the MIZ once waters within the pack began to freeze persistently later in the season. Probability of detection was higher with distance into the MIZ. Supporting these findings, the density index was strongly related to ice concentration in an inverse relationship. The strong relationship to polynyas and the MIZ indicate that sea-ice divergence altered by decadal or longer-term climate change, as described in the recent literature, could well affect any apparent, long-term trends evident in this species' abundance if surveyed only in open or near-to-ice waters. We speculate on how the minke whale's pagophilic nature (1) could have been encouraged by large-scale industrial whaling and by competition with species more characteristic of open waters and the outer MIZ, and (2) may have protected the population somewhat during industrial whaling resulting in the much greater abundance of this species now compared to other targeted species.},

Our experiment entailed replicate transects through markedly altered physical habitat in the Scotia-Weddell Confluence: a series of storms caused the pack ice to advance and retreat rapidly and repeatedly over a 200-km-wide area. Regardless of where their habitat moved, pack-ice and open-water species occurred at significantly higher densities in the ice and open-water habitats, respectively. There were no time lags in the response of species to habitat alteration. In addition, pack-ice and open-water species had identical diets regardless of where their preferred habitat was located. These results supported the hypothesis and showed that physical rather than biological variables affect species composition among pelagic assemblages of Antarctic seabirds. Results supported the conclusion that a lack of appropriate adaptations constrain open-water species to reside away from the pack ice and that unremarkable prey availability fails to attract pack-ice species to open waters.},

  abstract = {Six out of ten adult Ross seals that were tagged with Argos satellite-linked dive recorders off Queen Maud Land, just after the moult in February, provided data on location and diving activity throughout a year. Shortly after tagging, the animals headed 2,000~km north and stayed pelagic in the area south of the Antarctic Polar Front, until October when they went south into the pack-ice. Throughout the year they made about 100 dives a day, most to a depth of 100--300~m, the deepest dive on record being 792~m, while some dives were very shallow during their stay in the pack-ice. Most dives, outside the breeding and moulting period, lasted for 5--15~min throughout the year. This diving behaviour is consistent with feeding on mid-water fish, like Pleurogramma antarcticum, squid, and to some extent krill (Euphausia superba), when in the pack-ice, and myctophid fish and several species of squid, when in the open ocean. The nursing period was 13~days in mid-November, and moulting occurs in late January--early February, which is the period when sightings surveys for this species should be done.},

The mean maximum diving depth estimated by the capillary-tube depth gauge technique was 37.8 m which, when compared with other studies, reflects good food availability in shallow waters around Harmony Point. Females dived significantly deeper than males and also reached the maximum dive depth registered (112.6 m). The analysis of the stomach contents recovered when the individuals with capillary-tubes returned to the nest from foraging trips indicated that males ingested almost exclusively large Notothenia coriiceps specimens, whereas females preyed more intensively on smaller fish. The differences observed suggest that individuals of both sexes partitioned foraging depths and food resources.}

The diving depths and duration recorded for these shags are the deepest and longest among all flying birds in Antarctica and match deep dives performed by small Antarctic penguins. Individual shags of both sexes partition foraging depths and food resources, which might diminish intra-specific competition. Like other sub-Antarctic shags, P. bransfieldensis and P. georgianus are bottom feeders that prey predominantly on demersal fish. In the southern Scotia Arc and west Antarctic Peninsula, nototheniids, mainly Notothenia coriiceps, constitute their main prey. Shag partners alternate the time at sea and, as the energy requirements at the nest increase, they increase the number but reduce the duration of the feeding trips. A steady declining trend in the number of breeding pairs of both species has been observed in the last decade at several Antarctic localities; this phenomenon at the South Shetland Islands might be at least partially explained by the effect of the commercial fishery on their prey. In inshore shallow waters shags occupy the trophic niche of main predators of demersal fish and play an important ecological role as regulators of populations of particular fish prey that have marked site fidelity. The potential use of shags as biomonitors in Antarctica is discussed.},

Rapid warming in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is coincident with increasing gentoo penguin and decreasing Ad{\'e}lie penguin populations, suggesting that competition for food may exacerbate the Ad{\'e}lie penguin decline. On fine scales, we tested for foraging competition between these species during the chick-rearing period by comparing their foraging behaviors with the distribution of their prey, Antarctic krill. We detected krill aggregations within the horizontal and vertical foraging ranges of Ad{\'e}lie and gentoo penguins and found that krill selected for habitats that balance the need to consume food and avoid predation. In overlapping Ad{\'e}lie and gentoo penguin foraging areas, four gentoo penguins switched foraging behavior by foraging at deeper depths, a strategy which limits competition with Ad{\'e}lie penguins. This suggests that climate-driven sympatry does not necessarily result in competitive exclusion of Ad{\'e}lie penguins by gentoo penguins. Contrary to a recent theory, which suggests that increased competition for krill is one of the major drivers of Ad{\'e}lie penguin population declines, we suggest that declines in Ad{\'e}lie penguins along the WAP are more likely due to direct and indirect climate impacts on their life histories.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing one of the fastest rates of regional climate change on Earth, resulting in the collapse of ice shelves, the retreat of glaciers and the exposure of new terrestrial habitat. In the nearby oceanic system, winter sea ice in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas has decreased in extent by 10\% per decade, and shortened in seasonal duration. Surface waters have warmed by more than 1{$\mkern1mu$}K since the 1950s, and the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has also warmed. Of the changes observed in the marine ecosystem of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region to date, alterations in winter sea ice dynamics are the most likely to have had a direct impact on the marine fauna, principally through shifts in the extent and timing of habitat for ice-associated biota. Warming of seawater at depths below               ca               100{$\mkern1mu$}m has yet to reach the levels that are biologically significant. Continued warming, or a change in the frequency of the flooding of CDW onto the WAP continental shelf may, however, induce sublethal effects that influence ecological interactions and hence food-web operation. The best evidence for recent changes in the ecosystem may come from organisms which record aspects of their population dynamics in their skeleton (such as molluscs or brachiopods) or where ecological interactions are preserved (such as in encrusting biota of hard substrata). In addition, a southwards shift of marine isotherms may induce a parallel migration of some taxa similar to that observed on land. The complexity of the Southern Ocean food web and the nonlinear nature of many interactions mean that predictions based on short-term studies of a small number of species are likely to be misleading.},

These changes are modulated by atmospheric forcing, including the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) pressure system. We utilized a novel 25-year (1993--2017) time series to model the effects of environmental variability on larvae of a keystone species, the Antarctic Silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica). Antarctic Silverfish use sea ice as spawning habitat and are important prey for penguins and other predators. We show that warmer sea surface temperature and decreased sea ice are associated with reduced larval abundance. Variability in the ASL modulates both sea surface temperature and sea ice; a strong ASL is associated with reduced larvae. These findings support a narrow sea ice and temperature tolerance for adult and larval fish. Further regional warming predicted to occur during the 21st century could displace populations of Antarctic Silverfish, altering this pelagic ecosystem.},

  abstract = {1. The rich zooplankton, fish and squid resources on the Patagonian Shelf sustain substantial populations of largely resident seabirds and marine mammals. These habitats are also visited seasonally by similar species from elsewhere but few data exist on their status and origin. Recent studies, using satellite-tracking to determine foraging ranges and feeding areas of seabirds and marine mammals breeding at South Georgia, have shown that several species make substantial use of the waters of the Patagonian Shelf. 2. Wandering albatrosses use shelf-edge areas year-round with direct observations of both sexes of almost all age classes, including, breeding, pre-breeding and non-breeding individuals. White-chinned petrels and female Northern and Southern giant petrels mainly visit during incubation and post-breeding, particularly to the Falklands Current (White-chinned petrels) and to upwelling areas around the southern shelf-break from the Burdwood Bank in the east to Staten Island and Diego Ramirez in the west (giant petrels). Northern giant petrel males during incubation and Antarctic fur seals in winter reach inner shelf habitats in the northern sector. In contrast, South Georgia populations of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses do not appear to use the Patagonian Shelf at any stage of their breeding cycle. 3. Although the use of the Patagonian Shelf by visiting species is now best documented for South Georgia species, recent observational data confirm that seabirds from Diego Ramirez, Tristan da Cunha and Gough visit the southern and northern sectors, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively. Several Antarctic species (notably Antarctic fulmar and cape petrel) winter in the region as do at least two albatross species from New Zealand; other species (especially Wilson's storm petrels) use it as a staging ground on migration, as do several species of baleen whales and possibly other cetacean species. 4. Three of the seabird species which breed on the Patagonian Shelf are Globally Threatened; seven of the visiting species (and four baleen whale species) also have this status. The Patagonian Shelf is, therefore, not only of global importance for the diversity and abundance of its resident top predators but is just as critical for the survival of many visiting species, some of which are even more endangered. 5. Combining data from satellite-tracking with conventional mapping from direct observations offers the prospect of defining the foraging ranges (and the main feeding areas within these) of a range of key top predator species. Such data should be used, in conjunction with similar information of the distributions of fish, squid and zooplankton resources and of fishing effort, to identify critical marine habitats whose precautionary, multiple-use sustainable management will be vital to protect the interests of both commercial fishers and top predators.

  abstract = {Significance             Little is known on whether structurally diverse ecological networks may respond abruptly to anthropogenic stress and even less on our ability to detect such responses in advance. By simulating mutualistic communities en route to a tipping point, we show how critical slowing-down indicators may be used as early warnings for the collapse of ecological networks. Our findings not only confirm the existence of the generic dynamical signatures of tipping points in ecological networks but also suggest a promising way for identifying most vulnerable components in a broad class of networks at the brink of collapse.           ,              Tipping points are crossed when small changes in external conditions cause abrupt unexpected responses in the current state of a system. In the case of ecological communities under stress, the risk of approaching a tipping point is unknown, but its stakes are high. Here, we test recently developed critical slowing-down indicators as early-warning signals for detecting the proximity to a potential tipping point in structurally complex ecological communities. We use the structure of 79 empirical mutualistic networks to simulate a scenario of gradual environmental change that leads to an abrupt first extinction event followed by a sequence of species losses until the point of complete community collapse. We find that critical slowing-down indicators derived from time series of biomasses measured at the species and community level signal the proximity to the onset of community collapse. In particular, we identify specialist species as likely the best-indicator species for monitoring the proximity of a community to collapse. In addition, trends in slowing-down indicators are strongly correlated to the timing of species extinctions. This correlation offers a promising way for mapping species resilience and ranking species risk to extinction in a given community. Our findings pave the road for combining theory on tipping points with patterns of network structure that might prove useful for the management of a broad class of ecological networks under global environmental change.},

Overall, krill and fish were the most frequent prey, occurring in an average of 97\% and 69\% of samples (n=128), followed by cephalopods (12\%). Myctophids constituted almost 90\% of the fish predated, with Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi being the most abundant and frequent species consumed. All fish taxa identified were krill-feeding species suggesting that seals foraged primarily on krill and opportunistically on fish species associated with krill swarms. A seasonal change observed in the relative proportions of the different fish prey taxa indicates that fur seals spent more time foraging over the shelf in summer and off the shelf in autumn. During the study period, commercial fishing in the area was not based upon any of the fish identified in this study.},

  abstract = {There is a paucity of information on the foraging ecology, especially individual use of sea-ice features and icebergs, over the non-breeding season in many seabird species. Using geolocators and stable isotopes, we defined the movements, distribution and diet of adult Antarctic petrels               Thalassoica antarctica               from the largest known breeding colony, the inland Svarthamaren, Antarctica. More specifically, we examined how sea-ice concentration and free-drifting icebergs affect the distribution of Antarctic petrels. After breeding, birds moved north to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Weddell sector of the Southern Ocean, following its northward extension during freeze-up in April, and they wintered there in April--August. There, the birds stayed predominantly out of the water (60--80\% of the time) suggesting they use icebergs as platforms to stand on and/or to rest. Feather {$\delta$}               15               N values encompassed one full trophic level, indicating that birds fed on various proportions of crustaceans and fish/squid, most likely Antarctic krill               Euphausia superba               and the myctophid fish               Electrona antarctica               and/or the squid               Psychroteuthis glacialis               . Birds showed strong affinity for the open waters of the northern boundary of the MIZ, an important iceberg transit area, which offers roosting opportunities and rich prey fields. The strong association of Antarctic petrels with sea-ice cycle and icebergs suggests the species can serve, year-round, as a sentinel of environmental changes for this remote region.},

Petrels form an important component of the high-latitude seabird assemblages in terms of species and individuals. The distribution and foraging ecology of three sympatric fulmarine petrels (Southern Fulmar               Fulmarus glacialoides               , Cape Petrel               Daption capense               and Snow Petrel               Pagodroma nivea               ) were studied at Ad{\'e}lie Land, East Antarctica, by combining information from miniaturized saltwater immersion geolocators and stable isotopes from feathers. During the breeding season at a large spatial scale (               c               .~200~km), the three species overlapped in their foraging areas located in the vicinity of the colonies but were segregated by their diet and trophic level, as indicated by the different chick               {$\delta$}               15               N values that increased in the order Cape Petrel~{$<~$}Southern Fulmar~{$<~$}Snow Petrel. During the non-breeding season, the three fulmarines showed species-specific migration strategies along a wide latitudinal gradient. Snow Petrels largely remained in ice-associated Antarctic waters, Southern Fulmars targeted primarily the sub-Antarctic zone and Cape Petrels migrated further north. Overall, birds spent less time in flight during the non-breeding period than during the breeding season, with the highest percentage of time spent sitting on the water occurring during the breeding season and at the beginning of the non-breeding period before migration. This activity pattern, together with the               {$\delta$}               13               C values of most feathers, strongly suggests that moult of the three fulmarine petrels occurred at that time in the very productive high Antarctic waters, where birds fed on a combination of crustaceans and fish. The study highlights different segregating mechanisms that allow the coexistence of closely related species, specifically, prey partitioning during the breeding season and spatial segregation at sea during the non-breeding season.},

  abstract = {The fish incidence, particularly notothenioids and myctophids, in the diet of non-breeding male Arctocephalus gazella in the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region is widely variable according to the studied locality. We made a comparative diet analysis on 158 fecal samples collected in summer 2005 at Hope Bay (HB), AP and at Stranger Point (SP), South Shetland Islands (SSI). The frequency of occurrence of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and fish as prey was similar at HB, whereas krill was predominant at SP. For each fish species identified based on the otoliths found, their relative importance in the diet was evaluated using the IRI index. Notothenioid fish prevailed at HB, Pleuragramma antarctica being the most important prey. Contrarily, the myctophids Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Electrona antarctica predominated at SP. Both benthopelagic and pelagic fish species were represented at HB, while the latter were more important at SP. Demersal nototheniid species (e.g., Trematomus spp.) were scarcely represented and only at HB, which might be related to a preference of fur seals for the more abundant pelagic prey there. At SP, demersal nototheniids were not represented in the scats. The fish species consumption was higher in diversity at SP in comparison with HB but low in overlap between the two sites. We surmise that the differences found in the dietary composition of fur seals from both sites could be related to 1---different topographical and hydrological conditions associated to the study areas; 2---historical finfish fisheries, which took place during the late 1970s at the SSI, but not in the AP. Our findings are compared with studies from other localities of the AP and the Scotia Arc.},

Recent identification of the Antarctic minke whale as the source of the seasonally ubiquitous bio-duck call has allowed the use of this sound, as well as downsweeps, to investigate seasonality trends and diel patterns in Antarctic minke whale call production, and their relationship to sea ice cover. Passive acoustic data were collected using an autonomous Acoustic Recording Package (ARP) off the western Antarctic Peninsula. Bio-duck calls were classified into four distinct call variants, with one variant having two subtypes. Bio-duck calls were detected between April and November, with increasing call duration during the austral winter, indicating a strong seasonality in call production. Downsweeps, which were also attributed to Antarctic minke whales, were present throughout most months during the recording period, with a peak in July, and an absence in March and April. Both bio-duck and downsweeps were significantly correlated with sea ice cover. No diel patterns were observed in bio-duck calls or in downsweep call production at this site.},

Since 2013, the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) has represented the most comprehensive compilation of bathymetry for the Southern Ocean south of 60{$^\circ$}S. Recently, the IBCSO Project has combined its efforts with the Nippon Foundation -- GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project supporting the goal of mapping the world's oceans by 2030. New datasets initiated a second version of IBCSO (IBCSO v2). This version extends to 50{$^\circ$}S (covering approximately 2.4 times the area of seafloor of the previous version) including the gateways of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic circumpolar frontal systems. Due to increased (multibeam) data coverage, IBCSO v2 significantly improves the overall representation of the Southern Ocean seafloor and resolves many submarine landforms in more detail. This makes IBCSO v2 the most authoritative seafloor map of the area south of 50{$^\circ$}S.},

(6) Minke and pilot whales may drive towards the surface food normally out of reach of seabirds, particularly Procellariformes. Common dolphins feed by herding fast-moving fish shoals into tight groups which will be a more concentrated food source for diving sea-birds, such as gannets, and make food more accessible to other species. Porpoises may achieve the same result with inshore shoals of sprats and sand eels, particularly for auks and kittiwakes, and terns.},

Daily consumption estimates averaged 67 g/bird for placenta and 11 g/bird for pup carcasses, which are 54\% and 26\% of daily energy requirements, respectively. Sheathbills spent 86\% of the day foraging or displaying and 14\% resting or preening. Actively feeding birds spent 38\% of the time searching for food, 20\% feeding, 23\% resting, 14\% on comfort activities, and 3\% in agonistic behaviors. /// La Paloma Ant{\'a}rtica (Chionis alba) es una especie oportunista depredadora y carro{\~n}era.

  abstract = {The recent identification of the bio-duck call as Antarctic minke whale (AMW) vocalization allows the use of passive acoustic monitoring to retrospectively investigate year-round spatial-temporal patterns in minke whale occurrence in ice-covered areas. Here, we present an analysis of AMW occurrence patterns based on a 9-year passive acoustic dataset (2008--2016) from 21 locations throughout the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Weddell Sea). AMWs were detected acoustically at all mooring locations from May to December, with the highest presence between August and November (bio-duck calls present at more than 80\% of days). At the southernmost recording locations, the bio-duck call was present up to 10 months of the year. Substantial inter-annual variation in the seasonality of vocal activity correlated to variation in local ice concentration. Our analysis indicates that part of the AMW population stays in the Weddell Sea during austral winter. The period with the highest acoustic presence in the Weddell Sea (September--October) coincides with the timing of the breeding season of AMW in lower latitudes. The bio-duck call could therefore play a role in mating, although other behavioural functions of the call cannot be excluded to date.},

  abstract = {Abstract             With environmental change, understanding how species recover from overharvesting and maintain viable populations is central to ecosystem restoration. Here, we reconstruct 90\,years of recovery trajectory of the Antarctic fur seal at South Georgia (S.W. Atlantic), a key indicator species in the krill-based food webs of the Southern Ocean. After being harvested to commercial extinction by 1907, this population rebounded and now constitutes the most abundant otariid in the World. However, its status remains uncertain due to insufficient and conflicting data, and anthropogenic pressures affecting Antarctic krill, an essential staple for millions of fur seals and other predators. Using integrated population models, we estimated simultaneously the long-term abundance for Bird Island, northwest South Georgia, epicentre of recovery of the species after sealing, and population adjustments for survey counts with spatiotemporal applicability. Applied to the latest comprehensive survey data, we estimated the population at South Georgia in 2007--2009 as 3,510,283 fur seals [95\% CI: 3,140,548--3,919,604] (ca. 98\% of global population), after 40\,years of maximum growth and range expansion owing to an abundant krill supply. At Bird Island, after 50\,years of exponential growth followed by 25\,years of slow stable growth, the population collapsed in 2009 and has thereafter declined by -7.2\% [-5.2, -9.1] per annum, to levels of the 1970s. For the instrumental record, this trajectory correlates with a time-varying relationship between coupled climate and sea surface temperature cycles associated with low regional krill availability, although the effects of increasing krill extraction by commercial fishing and natural competitors remain uncertain. Since 2015, fur seal longevity and recruitment have dropped, sexual maturation has retarded, and population growth is expected to remain mostly negative and highly variable. Our analysis documents the rise and fall of a key Southern Ocean predator over a century of profound environmental and ecosystem change.},

Black-browed Albatross (Diomedea melanophris), Macaroni Penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus), and prions (Pachyptila spp.) were the most abundant species. Most flocks were in the vicinity of a large inshore patch of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and most observed feeding was by Black-browed Albatross, which appeared to initiate and dominate the flocks. Short feeding bouts by surface-feeding species appeared to be coupled with the surfacing of penguins and seals. We conclude that foraging penguins and seals caused prey to approach the surface where near-surface foraging species could feed.},

Information on AMW densities in the sea ice-covered parts of the Southern Ocean is required to contextualize abundance estimates obtained from circumpolar shipboard surveys in open waters, suggesting a 30\% decline in AMW abundance. Conventional line-transect shipboard surveys for density estimation are impossible in ice-covered regions, therefore we used icebreaker-supported helicopter surveys to obtain information on AMW densities along gradients of 0\%--100\% of ice concentration. We conducted five helicopter surveys in the Southern Ocean, between 2006 and 2013. Distance sampling data, satellite-derived sea-ice data, and bathymetric parameters were used in generalized additive models (GAMs) to produce predictions on how the density of AMWs varied over space and time, and with environmental covariates. Ice concentration, distance to the ice edge and distance from the shelf break were found to describe the distribution of AMWs. Highest densities were predicted at the ice edge and through to medium ice concentrations. Medium densities were found up to 500~km into the ice edge in all concentrations of ice. Very low numbers of AMWs were found in the ice-free waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). A consistent relationship between AMW distribution and sea ice concentration weakens the support for the hypothesis that varying numbers of AMWs in ice-covered waters were responsible for observed changes in estimated abundance. The potential decline in AMW abundance stresses the need for conservation measures and further studies into the AMW population status. Very low numbers of AMWs recorded in the ice-free waters along the WAP support the hypothesis that this species is strongly dependent on sea ice and that forecasted sea ice changes have the potential of heavily impacting AMWs.},

  abstract = {Estimates of daily activity and consequent demand for food during winter are scarce for many polar seabirds, yet essential for assessing constraints on foraging effort, demand for food, and potential competition with local fisheries. We affixed archival temperature tags to gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) from two colonies in the South Shetland Islands to measure the frequency, timing, and duration of foraging trips and to estimate minimum food requirements during winter. Foraging trip frequencies ranged from 0.85 to 1.0 trips day-1 and were positively correlated with day length. Early winter foraging trips more closely matched day length than late winter foraging trips. The data suggest that individuals maximize foraging time during the early winter period, likely to recover body mass following the breeding season and molt. The more attenuated response of foraging trip durations to increasing day length in late winter may be related to differences in local resource availability or individual behaviors prior to the upcoming breeding season. Minimum food requirements also exhibited a seasonal cycle with a mid-winter minimum. On average, minimum food requirements were estimated at 0.70~{\textpm}~0.12~kg~day-1. Extrapolated to the regional population of gentoo penguins, winter food requirements by gentoo penguins were equivalent to roughly 33\% of annual krill catches by commercial fisheries in the South Shetland Island region over the past decade. Current expansion of the gentoo population and the krill fishery in the southern Scotia Sea warrants continued monitoring of gentoo penguins during winter.},

  abstract = {Seabirds commonly gather into mixed-species flocks to feed on fish schools and other concentrations of prey. We group Alaskan and Washington seabird feeding flocks into three types on the bases of flock size and longevity and the nature of the food source. Small, short-lived flocks over tightly clumped prey are called Type I; larger (5,000+ individuals), longer-lasting flocks over less tightly clumped and less reactive prey are called Type II; Type III flocks form where zooplankton and other organisms are concentrated by downwelling. Birds participating in the flocks are assigned to four functional groups (some species fit into two groups): catalysts (larids and shearwaters) are highly visible birds that other birds watch and follow to food sources; divers (alcids, loons, cormorants) exploit the food sources underwater by pursuit diving; kleptoparasites (jaegers and gulls) steal food from other flock members; and suppressors (shearwaters and cormorants) interfere behaviorally with the feeding of other flock members by reducing the effective prey availability.Most flocks occurred within a few kilometers of shore. Type I flocks on the Washington coast averaged larger, lasted longer, and contained more species than Alaskan Type I flocks. The Washington and Alaska flocks contained about the same number of locally breeding species, but the Washington flocks also contained several migrant species that breed elsewhere in North America. Both contained shearwaters, migrants from the southern hemisphere, but the shearwaters were much more important in the Alaskan flocks.Black-legged Kittiwakes and shearwaters (catalysts) initiated most Alaskan flocks and were important in the development of flocks initiated by other birds. Once a flock was initiated, it grew until the food source became unavailable or until the local pool of prospective flock members was exhausted. The divers were able to discriminate from considerable distances between kittiwakes feeding on single fish and kittiwakes feeding on fish schools and approached only the latter. The various species tended to occupy characteristic positions within Type I flocks. Gulls and kittiwakes were central, and the various divers took peripheral positions. Kleptoparasitism by jaegers did not appear to influence Type I flock organization. Shearwaters, the most important suppressors, sometimes pursuit-plunged into fish schools and euphausiid shoals in such numbers that the prey concentrations were drastically reduced, scattered, or driven downward in seconds, and other birds were then unable to feed.Type II flocks were divisible into two groups, one consisting largely of kittiwakes and shearwaters and feeding on capelin, and the other dominated by shearwaters and feeding on pelagic crustaceans. Kleptoparasitism by Pomarine Jaegers in the capelin-based Type II flocks was frequent and differed from the kleptoparasitism of solitary birds in that the jaegers preferentially attacked birds carrying fish in their bills. Suppression appeared unimportant in capelin-based Type II flocks but probably kept alcids and gulls from joining the crustacean-based flocks. In some island groups Type III flocks occurred daily. They were less regular in structure and composition than Type I or Type II flocks.Kleptoparasitism by gulls and kittiwakes tended to keep puffins and other alcids on the edges of the flocks. The alcids' underwater approaches to the fish schools from the sides may have tended to keep the schools compact and near the surface. It has been hypothesized that the antipredator function of schooling by baitfish involves predator satiation and the difficulty of locating schools. Schooling does not function as a deterrent to aerial predators in the same way that it does to swimming ones, however. Either birds are less important as predators, or schooling confers a different advantage in escaping aerial predation. Apparently, fish schools can escape rather quickly from bird flocks by descending away from the surface out of visual contact.},

Using {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values in vibrissae from 53 seals, we examined the trophic ecology of crabeater seals from the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) in 2001, 2002 and 2007. We observed a wide variability in individual seal mean {$\delta$}13C values, which ranged from -19.8‰ to -24.9‰ , whereas mean {$\delta$}15N value varied from 5.4‰ to 7.9‰. We identified a positive significant effect of seal mass on {$\delta$}13C values, as well as a significant seasonal effect (higher {$\delta$}13C values in austral winter), which likely resulted from changes in the composition of the community of primary producers. {$\delta$}15N values for crabeater seals, on the other hand, were affected by year, with individuals in 2002 having higher {$\delta$}15N values. The median (with range) contribution of Antarctic krill to the diet of crabeater seals, as estimated using the Bayesian mixing model MixSIR, was 87.9\% (81.2 to 94.8\%). During 2002, krill biomass in the wAP was at one of its lowest levels during the last 2 decades, coinciding with a slight reduction in the importance of krill for the diet of the seals that year, which reached 84.5\% (75.1 to 92.4\%). Despite the relative plasticity observed in the diet of crabeater seals, it is unknown to what extent, and at what rate, crabeater seals might be able to switch to a more generalized diet, which might impact their fitness, given the ongoing environmental change along the wAP.},

We identified clusters of bird species, ``communities'' with similar distributions, and examined the extent to which the distributions of these seabird communities reflected the underlying physical oceanography of the region. Based on temperature, salinity and silicon data, we identified 11 water masses which resulted from varying degrees of mixing of water from the Pacific Basin, the Bellingshausen Sea, the Weddell Sea and terrestrial runoff. Seabird species assemblages were associated with contiguous clusters of water masses, suggesting a response by the birds to apparently subtle differences in their marine habitat.},

However, recent studies have documented cooling in the AP since the late 1990s. This study aims to place temperature changes in the AP and West Antarctica into a larger spatial and temporal perspective by analyzing monthly station-based surface temperature observations since 1957 across the extratropical Southern Hemisphere, along with sea surface temperature (SST) data and mean sea level pressure reanalysis data. The results confirm statistically significant cooling in station observations and SST trends throughout the AP region since 1999. However, the full 60-yr period shows statistically significant, widespread warming across most of the Southern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. Positive SST trends broadly reflect these warming trends, especially in the midlatitudes. After confirming the importance of the southern annular mode (SAM) on southern high-latitude climate variability, the influence is removed from the station temperature records, revealing statistically significant background warming across all of the extratropical Southern Hemisphere. Antarctic temperature trends in a suite of climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are then investigated. Consistent with previous work the CMIP5 models warm Antarctica at the background temperature rate that is 2 times faster than that observed. However, removing the SAM influence from both CMIP5 and observed temperatures results in Antarctic trends that differ only modestly, perhaps due to natural multidecadal variability remaining in the observations.},

  abstract = {The foraging location, diving behavior, dietary composition, and feeding rates of female Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) from the Auster and Taylor Glacier colonies in Antarctica were investigated during the 1993 austral winter. The study was conducted between late May and early August, when male emperors remain at the colonies to incubate eggs and females forage at sea for self-maintenance. During winter, two satellite-tracked penguins from Auster foraged {$\approx$}100 km northeast of the colony in open water 200--500 m deep, over the outer continental shelf and shelf slope. Ten Auster and four Taylor Glacier penguins that carried time--depth recorders took {$\approx$}8 d to reach the ice edge, spent 50--60 d at sea foraging, and took 4 d to return across the fast ice to the colony. The females occasionally huddled together to minimize heat loss while in transit to the ice edge and between foraging days. The penguins foraged on 93.2\% of their days at sea and rested for the remainder. On each foraging day, penguins usually entered the water just after dawn and averaged 4.71 h in the water before exiting at dusk. The hourly dive rate was constant throughout winter, but the daily dive rate increased as day length increased, suggesting that day length is a primary determinant of hunting effort. Penguins exhibited behavior indicative of foraging on 47\% of their dives, the remainder being travel or search dives. Penguins made, on average, 26 foraging dives/d. Females from Auster targeted prey at water depths of 20--70 m and 100--150 m, whereas Taylor Glacier birds targeted prey at 10--70 m, 250--300 m, and 330--400 m, suggesting between-colony differences in prey distribution. The stomach contents of 17 females returning to Auster to brood their chicks were dominated by pelagic prey species: Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, 70\% by mass) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum, 13\% by mass). Food consumption rates during winter for five penguins from both colonies were similar and averaged 62.6 {\textpm} 5.8 g{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}d-1 (1.8 {\textpm} 0.1 kg/d for a 28.8 kg female), which equated to a metabolizable energy intake of 236.6 {\textpm} 22.0 kJ/kg for each day they foraged (all values are mean {\textpm} 1 sd). This enabled the birds to gain {$\approx$}6.1 kg for a trip spanning {$\approx$}70 d. Based on mean prey masses and the penguins' dive rates, the penguins consumed {$\approx$}115 {\texttimes} 0.6 g krill or 16 {\texttimes} 4.3 g Antarctic silverfish per foraging dive, or some combination of both. In their winter trip, each breeding female consumed {$\approx$}100 kg of prey. The female populations at Auster and Taylor Glacier consumed an estimated 1350 Mg and 250 Mg of prey, respectively, in winter.},

  abstract = {Antarctic fur seals (AFS) are an ecologically important predator and a focal indicator species for ecosystem-based Antarctic fisheries management. This species suffered intensive anthropogenic exploitation until the early 1900s, but recolonized most of its former distribution, including the southern-most colony at Cape Shirreff, South Shetland Islands (SSI). The IUCN describes a single, global AFS population of               least concern               ; however, extensive genetic analyses clearly identify four distinct breeding stocks, including one in the SSI. To update the population status of SSI AFS, we analyzed 20 years of field-based data including population counts, body size and condition, natality, recruitment, foraging behaviors, return rates, and pup mortality at the largest SSI colony. Our findings show a precipitous decline in AFS abundance (86\% decrease since 2007), likely driven by leopard seal predation (increasing since 2001,               p               \&lt;\&lt; 0.001) and potentially worsening summer foraging conditions. We estimated that leopard seals consumed an average of 69.3\% (range: 50.3--80.9\%) of all AFS pups born each year since 2010. AFS foraging-trip durations, an index of their foraging habitat quality, were consistent with decreasing krill and fish availability. Significant improvement in the age-specific over-winter body condition of AFS indicates that observed population declines are driven by processes local to the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The loss of SSI AFS would substantially reduce the genetic diversity of the species, and decrease its resilience to climate change. There is an urgent need to reevaluate the conservation status of Antarctic fur seals, particularly for the rapidly declining SSI population.}

Here, using a 5-year dataset of eukaryotic plankton DNA metabarcoding, we assess changes in biodiversity and net community production in this region. Our results show that sea-ice extent is a dominant factor influencing eukaryotic plankton community composition, biodiversity, and net community production. Species richness and evenness decline with an increase in sea surface temperature (SST). In regions with low SST and shallow mixed layers, the community was dominated by a diverse assemblage of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Conversely, less diverse plankton assemblages were observed in waters with higher SST and/or deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic programming machine-learning model explained up to 80\% of the net community production variability at the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best predictor of net community production. We conclude that eukaryotic plankton diversity and carbon cycling at the Western Antarctic Peninsula are strongly linked to sea-ice conditions.},

To relate behaviors with environmental variables, features must be evaluated at scales relevant to the animal or behavior. Remotely sensed environmental data, collected via satellites, often suffers from the effects of cloud cover and lacks the spatial or temporal resolution to adequately link with individual animal behaviors or behavioral bouts. This study establishes a new method for remotely and continuously quantifying surface ice concentration (SIC) at a scale relevant to individual whales using on-animal tag video data.                                         Results                                Motion-sensing and video-recording suction cup tags were deployed on 7 Antarctic minke whales (                 Balaenoptera bonaerensis                 ) around the Antarctic Peninsula in February and March of 2018. To compare the scale of camera-tag observations with satellite imagery, the area of view was simulated using camera-tag parameters. For expected conditions, we found the visible area maximum to be\,{\textasciitilde}\,100m                 2                 which indicates that observations occur at an equivalent or finer scale than a single pixel of high-resolution visible spectrum satellite imagery. SIC was classified into one of six bins (0\%, 1--20\%, 21--40\%, 41--60\%, 61--80\%, 81--100\%) by two independent observers for the initial and final surfacing between dives. In the event of a disagreement, a third independent observer was introduced, and the median of the three observer's values was used. Initial results (                 n                 \,=\,6) show that Antarctic minke whales in the coastal bays of the Antarctic Peninsula spend 52\% of their time in open water, and only 15\% of their time in water with SIC greater than 20\%. Over time, we find significant variation in observed SIC, indicating that Antarctic minke occupy an extremely dynamic environment. Sentinel-2 satellite-based approaches of sea ice assessment were not possible because of persistent cloud cover during the study period.                                                        Conclusion               Tag-video offers a means to evaluate ice concentration at spatial and temporal scales relevant to the individual. Combined with information on underwater behavior, our ability to quantify SIC continuously at the scale of the animal will improve upon current remote sensing methods to understand the link between animal behavior and these dynamic environmental variables.},

  abstract = {This study reviewed published data on dietary preferences of beaked whales (Ziphiidae) from stomach contents analysis. Detailed data were only available for three of the six beaked whale genera (Hyperoodon, Mesoplodon and Ziphius). Stomach samples of these three beaked whale genera primarily contained cephalopod and fish remains, although some also contained crustaceans. Mesoplodon spp. were found to contain the most fish, with some species containing nothing but fish remains, while the southern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon planifrons) and Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) rarely, if ever, contained fish. Of cephalopods identified, Histioteuthid, Gonatid, Cranchiid and Onychoteuthid species usually contributed most to prey numbers and biomass for all beaked whale genera. There was a wide range of species and families of cephalopods recorded from stomach contents, with no obvious preference for bioluminescent prey species, vertical migrating prey species or prey species with specific body compositions. Whales of the genus Mesoplodon generally contained smaller prey, such as cephalopods under 500\hspace{0.166em}g in weight, compared with other beaked whales. Hyperoodon and Ziphius frequently contained much larger cephalopods with many important prey species having a mean weight of over 1000\hspace{0.166em}g. This suggests that Mesoplodon occupies a separate dietary niche from Hyperoodon and Ziphius, which may be an example of niche segregation. In contrast, Hyperoodon and Ziphius appear to occupy very similar dietary niches but have geographically segregated distributions, with Hyperoodon occupying cold-temperate to polar waters and Ziphius occupying warm-temperate to tropical waters.},

  abstract = {Although Antarctic sea ice is undergoing a slight increase in overall extent, major regional changes are occurring in its spatio-temporal characteristics (most notably in sea ice seasonality). Biologically significant aspects of Antarctic sea ice are evaluated, emphasising the importance of scale and thermodynamics versus dynamics. Changing sea ice coverage is having major direct and indirect though regionally-dependent effects on ecosystem structure and function, with the most dramatic known effects to date occurring in the West Antarctic Peninsula region. There is mounting evidence that loss of sea ice has affected multiple levels of the marine food web in a complex fashion and has triggered cascading effects. Impacts on primary production, Antarctic krill, fish, marine mammals and birds are assessed, and are both negative and positive. The review includes recent analysis of change/variability in polynyas and fast ice, and also highlights the significance of extreme events (which have paradoxical impacts). Possible future scenarios are investigated in the light of the predicted decline in sea ice by 2100 e.g. increased storminess/waviness, numbers of icebergs and snowfall. Our current lack of knowledge on many aspects of sea ice-related change and biological response is emphasised.},

  abstract = {A dominant Antarctic ecological paradigm suggests that winter sea ice is generally the main feeding ground for krill larvae. Observations from our winter cruise to the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean contradict this view and present the first evidence that the pack-ice zone is a food-poor habitat for larval development. In contrast, the more open marginal ice zone provides a more favourable food environment for high larval krill growth rates. We found that complex under-ice habitats are, however, vital for larval krill when water column productivity is limited by light, by providing structures that offer protection from predators and to collect organic material released from the ice. The larvae feed on this sparse ice-associated food during the day. After sunset, they migrate into the water below the ice (upper 20\,m) and drift away from the ice areas where they have previously fed. Model analyses indicate that this behaviour increases both food uptake in a patchy food environment and the likelihood of overwinter transport to areas where feeding conditions are more favourable in spring.},

  abstract = {The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a highly productive marine ecosystem where extended periods of change have been observed in the form of glacier retreat, reduction of sea-ice cover and shifts in marine populations, among others. The physical environment on the shelf is known to be strongly influenced by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flowing along the shelf slope and carrying warm, nutrient-rich water, by cold waters flooding into the northern Bransfield Strait from the Weddell Sea, by an extensive network of glaciers and ice shelves, and by strong seasonal to inter-annual variability in sea-ice formation and air--sea interactions, with significant modulation by climate modes like El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode. However, significant gaps have remained in understanding the exchange processes between the open ocean and the shelf, the pathways and fate of oceanic water intrusions, the shelf heat and salt budgets, and the long-term evolution of the shelf properties and circulation. Here, we review how recent advances in long-term monitoring programmes, process studies and newly developed numerical models have helped bridge these gaps and set future research challenges for the WAP system.

We collected data on abundance and distribution, providing a critical reference for sub-Antarctic conservation in anticipation of future environmental changes. We found significant changes in the abundance of 29\% of species surveyed and a consequent change in species diversity. We postulate that the resulting~altered community composition may have previously unanticipated population effects on the component species, due to changes in positive interactions among species which use each other as cues to the presence of prey. We found a near threefold reduction in spatial overlap among vertebrate predators, associated with warming sea temperatures. As the strength and opportunity for positive associations decreases in the future, feeding success may be negatively impacted. In this way, environmental changes may disproportionately impact predator abundances and such changes are likely already underway, as Southern Ocean temperatures have increased substantially since our surveys. Of course the changes we describe are not solely due to changing sea temperature or any other single cause---many factors are important and we do not claim to have removed these from consideration. Rather, we report previously undocumented changes in positive associations among species, and argue these changes may continue into the future, given near-certain continued increases in climate-related changes.},

Sea ice spreads over vast areas and has major impacts on the rest of the climate system, reflecting solar radiation and restricting ocean/atmosphere exchanges. The satellite record reveals that a gradual, decades-long overall increase in Antarctic sea ice extents reversed in 2014, with subsequent rates of decrease in 2014--2017 far exceeding the more widely publicized decay rates experienced in the Arctic. The rapid decreases reduced the Antarctic sea ice extents to their lowest values in the 40-y record, both on a yearly average basis (record low in 2017) and on a monthly basis (record low in February 2017).           ,                             Following over 3 decades of gradual but uneven increases in sea ice coverage, the yearly average Antarctic sea ice extents reached a record high of 12.8 {\texttimes} 10               6               km               2               in 2014, followed by a decline so precipitous that they reached their lowest value in the 40-y 1979--2018 satellite multichannel passive-microwave record, 10.7 {\texttimes} 10               6               km               2               , in 2017. In contrast, it took the Arctic sea ice cover a full 3 decades to register a loss that great in yearly average ice extents. Still, when considering the 40-y record as a whole, the Antarctic sea ice continues to have a positive overall trend in yearly average ice extents, although at 11,300 {\textpm} 5,300 km               2               {$\cdot$}y               -1               , this trend is only 50\% of the trend for 1979--2014, before the precipitous decline. Four of the 5 sectors into which the Antarctic sea ice cover is divided all also have 40-y positive trends that are well reduced from their 2014--2017 values. The one anomalous sector in this regard, the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has a 40-y negative trend, with the yearly average ice extents decreasing overall in the first 3 decades, reaching a minimum in 2007, and exhibiting an overall upward trend since 2007 (i.e., reflecting a reversal in the opposite direction from the other 4 sectors and the Antarctic sea ice cover as a whole).},

Identifications were based on the relative size and orientation of the white eyepatch and the presence or absence of a dorsal cape. Type A (presumably the nominate form) has a medium-sized eyepatch oriented parallel to the body axis, no dorsal cape, it occurs mainly off-shore in ice-free water, has a circumpolar distribution and apparently preys mainly upon Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). Type B also has an eyepatch oriented parallel to the body axis, but the eyepatch is at least twice as large as in Type A, it has a dorsal cape, mainly inhabits inshore waters, regularly occurs in pack-ice, is distributed around the continent and is regularly sighted in the Antarctic Peninsula area. Although it may also prey upon Antarctic minke whales and possibly humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), seals seem to be the most important prey item. Type C has a small, forward-slanted eyepatch, a dorsal cape, inhabits inshore waters and lives mainly in the pack-ice; it occurs mostly off East Antarctica, and to date it has been recorded feeding only on Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni). Type C appears to be referable to Orcinus glacialis as described by Berzin and Vladimirov (1983). Although similar ecological specialisations have been reported for sympatric killer whale populations in the Northeast Pacific (i.e. an inshore mammal-eater, an inshore fish-eater and an offshore form), the extent of morphological divergence, habitat segregation and, perhaps, reproductive isolation, appears to be more pronounced among Antarctic populations. Although under a Biological Species Concept these forms appear to warrant separate species status, it will be important to show that this interpretation is consistent with results of molecular genetic analyses and additional morphological studies.},

In this study we examined the ability of the stable isotope analysis ({$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C) of milk to infer seasonal variations in the diets and foraging habitats of female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica. We found that the stable nitrogen values of lipid-free milk were correlated with seasonal changes in female diet composition during the lactation period identified from scat collections. While we could not fully quantifying female diets using isotopic analysis, evidence from both scat collections and stable isotope analysis suggest that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) remained a major dietary item throughout lactation. In addition, these two methods independently highlighted the increasing importance of fish and squid in the diets of females as the season progresses. Furthermore, the isotopic values of milk collected during the perinatal fast suggest that females may be foraging in high productivity areas north of the South Shetland Islands and consume a larger proportion of fish and/or squid prior to parturition. While more confirmatory studies are needed to refine these methods, our results suggests that the {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C values of lipid-free milk can be used as a proxy to describe the foraging ecology of female Antarctic fur seals prior to and across the lactation period.},

  abstract = {Climate change will affect Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, krill-dependent predators, and fisheries in the Southern Ocean as areas typically covered by sea ice become ice-free in some winters. Research cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of magnitude higher (8 krill m-2) compared to summer (0.25 krill m-2), and this pattern was observed in all winters regardless of ice cover. Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude higher ({\textasciitilde}5500000 metric tons [t] in 2014) than a 15 yr summer average (520000 t). Looking at krill-dependent predators, during winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in Bransfield Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and in an area that is becoming more frequently ice-free. While long-term projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions, alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the impacts of long-term climate change.},

  abstract = {Waters off the western Antarctic Peninsula (i.e., the eastern Bellingshausen Sea) are unusually complex owing to the convergence of several major fronts. Determining the relative influence of fronts on occurrence patterns of top-trophic species in that area, therefore, has been challenging. In one of the few ocean-wide seabird data syntheses, in this case for the Southern Ocean, we analyzed ample, previously collected cruise data, Antarctic-wide, to determine seabird species assemblages and quantitative relationships to fronts as a way to provide context to the long-term Palmer LTER and the winter Southern Ocean GLOBEC studies in the eastern Bellingshausen Sea. Fronts investigated during both winter (April--September) and summer (October--March) were the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which separates the High Antarctic from the Low Antarctic water mass, and within which are embedded the marginal ice zone and Antarctic Shelf Break Front; and the Antarctic Polar Front, which separates the Low Antarctic and the Subantarctic water masses. We used clustering to determine species' groupings with water masses, and generalized additive models to relate species' densities, biomass and diversity to distance to respective fronts. Antarctic-wide, in both periods, highest seabird densities and lowest species diversity were found in the High Antarctic water mass. In the eastern Bellingshausen, seabird density in the High Antarctic water mass was lower (as low as half that of winter) than found in other Antarctic regions. During winter, Antarctic-wide, two significant species groups were evident: one dominated by Ad{\'e}lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) (High Antarctic water mass) and the other by petrels and prions (no differentiation among water masses); in eastern Bellingshausen waters during winter, the one significant species group was composed of species from both Antarctic-wide groups. In summer, Antarctic-wide, a High Antarctic group dominated by Ad{\'e}lie penguins, a Low Antarctic group dominated by petrels, and a Subantarctic group dominated by albatross were evident. In eastern Bellingshausen waters during summer, groups were inconsistent. With regard to frontal features, Antarctic-wide in winter, distance to the ice edge was an important explanatory factor for nine of 14 species, distance to the Antarctic Polar Front for six species and distance to the Shelf Break Front for six species; however, these Antarctic-wide models could not successfully predict spatial relationships of winter seabird density (individual species or total) and biomass in the eastern Bellingshausen. Antarctic-wide in summer, distance to land/Antarctic continent was important for 10 of 18 species, not a surprising result for these summer-time Antarctic breeders, as colonies are associated with ice-free areas of coastal land. Distance to the Shelf Break Front was important for 8 and distance to the southern boundary of the ACC was important for 7 species. These summer models were more successful in predicting eastern Bellingshausen species density and species diversity but failed to predict total seabird density or biomass. Antarctic seabirds appear to respond to fronts in a way similar to that observed along the well-studied upwelling front of the California Current. To understand fully the seabird patterns found in this synthesis, multi-disciplinary at-sea investigations, including a quantified prey field, are needed.},

  abstract = {We studied the foraging areas and diving depths of male emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri raising chicks at Pointe G{\'e}ologie, Ad{\'e}lie Land, in relation to bathymetry and sea-ice conditions during the first foraging trip after incubation in August 1996 and 1997. Combining satellite-tracking and dive-recording devices on the same penguins allowed individual dives to be localised and related to water depth. The penguins mostly dived in zones less than 300 m deep, where they performed 50\% of their dives and spent 54\% of their bottom time near the sea floor, on average. Analyses including bathymetry and sea-ice cover for the 2 years suggest that after leaving the colony the penguins targeted the nearest available, fast-ice free shallow shelf waters ({$<$}300 m). Once in these areas, the penguins foraged by diving near the sea floor during most of the remaining part of their foraging trip. Day-by-day analysis showed that during this central part of the foraging trip, 68\% of the dives ended near the sea floor. The most likely function of these dives appeared to be feeding on benthic or bentho-pelagic prey. Benthic dives were rare during the first and last days of trips, when penguins were apparently in transit. Benthic feeding is interpreted as a strategy towards predictable prey during a critical stage of the breeding cycle. Shallow areas of the Antarctic continental shelf may be important for some emperor penguin colonies around Antarctica. The importance of the benthic strata for this top predator of the Antarctic shelf ecosystem gives new insights on the trophic networks in the pack-ice during the Antarctic winter.},

Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4--6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Ad{\'e}lie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem.},

Using data from a shipboard survey during August 2012, I test the hypothesis that relative abundance of seabird and marine mammals reflects environmental variability associated with the dynamic pack ice zone. Using environmental data and observations of sea ice concentration, I quantified an environmental gradient that describes the spatial organization of the dynamic pack ice zone. The relationship of top predators to this environmental gradient revealed three important aspects: (1) an open water and pack ice community is present with some top predator species exhibiting higher abundance associated with moderate sea ice concentration (40--60~\%) as opposed to the pack ice edge (10~\%), (2) Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were the most abundant pinniped and they were observed resting on ice floes and foraging within leads and polynyas, and (3) for the most abundant species, spatial regression models indicate that latitude and sea ice concentration (a principal north/south gradient) are the most important environmental determinants. Winter ocean conditions may strongly influence population dynamics of top predators; therefore, information regarding their habitat use during winter is needed for understanding ecosystem dynamics.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula region is undergoing rapid change: a warming in winter of almost 6{$^\circ$}C since 1950, the loss of six ice shelves, the retreat of 87\% of the marine glaciers, and decreases in winter sea-ice duration. Concurrently, there is evidence of ecosystem change along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP). Since the life histories of most polar marine species are synchronized with the seasonal cycle of sea ice, we assess how the seasonal sea-ice cycle is changing in the wAP region. Four new metrics of seasonal sea-ice variability were extracted from spatial maps of satellite derived daily sea-ice concentration: (a) day of advance, (b) day of retreat, (c) the total number of sea-ice days (between day of advance and retreat), and (d) the percent time sea-ice was present (or sea-ice persistence). The spatio-temporal variability describes distinct on-to-offshore and alongshore differences in ice--ocean marine habitats, characterized overall by a longer sea-ice season in coastal regions (6.8--7.9 months) versus a shorter sea-ice season over the shelf (4.1--5.3 months), with on-to-offshore differences increasing south-to-north. Large perturbations in the seasonality of the marine habitat occur in association with ENSO and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) variability. The local atmospheric response to these climate modes is largely a strengthening of the meridional winds during spring-to-autumn, which in turn affect the timing of the sea-ice retreat and subsequent advance. These perturbations are embedded in overall trends towards a later sea-ice advance, earlier retreat and consequently shorter sea-ice season, the impacts of which are expected to affect ecosystem functionality in the wAP region. A suite of ocean--atmosphere--ice interactions are described that are consistent with the amplified warming in late autumn, early winter.},

Seals that normally bred in the eastern part of McMurdo Sound spent most of the winter in the middle and northern parts of McMurdo Sound before the annual shore-fast ice had formed in those areas, or in the pack ice 0--50{\enspace}km north of the sound and Ross Island. This is a greater use of pack ice, as opposed to shore-fast ice, in winter than was previously believed. Some long-distance movements (one over 1500{\enspace}km in total) to the middle and northwestern parts of the Ross Sea also occurred. Although highly variable within and between individuals, dives indicative of foraging were primarily to mid-water regions (100 -- 350{\enspace}m) in both years, and were similar to those that have been observed in spring and summer, when Pleuragramma antarcticum is the primary prey of Weddell seals in McMurdo Sound.},

We examined the spatial distributions of pelagic seabirds and fur seals near South Georgia, and asked to what extent the distributions of these predators were influenced by the spatial distribution of their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana. One novel aspect of our analysis is an explicit consideration of the separation in space between swarms of krill and aggregations of predators that feed upon krill. 2. Our data were collected in February 1986, during a systematic shipboard survey of the waters surrounding Bird Island, South Georgia. Predator abundance was estimated visually using strip transects, and krill abundance was simultaneously estimated using a hull-mounted echosounder. 3. We approached the difficult analytical problems associated with spatial distributions of organisms by using spatial autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis, regression models with spatial terms, and randomization tests. The randomization tests involved repeated simulations of predator distributions, and subsequent estimation of spatial association between predators and prey. 4. Pelagic birds and seals were distributed in a strikingly non-random fashion at sea near South Georgia; their distributional patterns were strongly influenced by the distribution of krill swarms. 5. Differences between predators in their spatial distribution and in their response to krill swarms suggest interspecific differences in foraging strategies.}

We observed high chlorophyll-               a               , low salinity, and shallow upper mixed-layer depths in 2014, and low chlorophyll-               a               , high salinity, and deep upper mixed-layer depths in 2016. Carbon sources varied among years, with most species enriched in {$\delta$}               13               C when ENSO conditions were dominant. Trophic position and body condition also varied among years, with different responses among species depending on conditions; inter-annual variation in {$\delta$}               15               N was minimal, while               E. triacantha               was the only species with notably lower body condition in 2016. We conclude that ENSO conditions around the northern Antarctic Peninsula may result in a more favorable feeding environment for all euphausiid species except               E. triacantha,               which may be the most negatively impacted by the predicted increase in ENSO conditions.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most rapidly warming regions on earth, and it is likely that the abundance and distribution of marine predators will change as a result.Procellariiform seabirds are highly mobile predators, which target specific habitat characteristics associated with underlying distributions of prey and areas of increased prey availability. We use ship surveys and hurdle models, to estimate the summer distribution and relative density of 11 seabird species within the northern Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. Models differed among species; however, sea surface temperature and depth were frequently associated with seabird occurrence and had the greatest explanatory power across many species. Null models based on observation data were better at predicting seabird density than models that included environmental covariates. This suggests that the main driver of distribution patterns is the broad-scale habitat features, and fine-scale aggregations within these ranges are harder to predict. Our seabird distribution models reflect known habitat associations, species hotspots, and community organization relative to oceanic and coastal marine processes. Application of species distribution models will benefit the assessments of critical habitat and potential responses to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance, which will provide insight into how species may change in polar ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Low catch limits for forage species are often considered to be precautionary measures that can help conserve marine predators. Difficulties measuring the impacts of fisheries removals on dependent predators maintain this perspective, but consideration of the spatio-temporal scales over which forage species, their predators, and fisheries interact can aid assessment of whether low catch limits are as precautionary as presumed. Antarctic krill are targeted by the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean and are key forage for numerous predators. Current krill removals are considered precautionary and have not been previously observed to affect krill-dependent predators, like penguins. Using a hierarchical model and 30+ years of monitoring data, we show that expected penguin performance was reduced when local harvest rates of krill were {$\geq$}0.1, and this effect was similar in magnitude to that of poor environmental conditions. With continued climate warming and high local harvest rates, future observations of penguin performance are predicted to be below the long-term mean with a probability of 0.77. Catch limits that are considered precautionary for forage species simply because the limit is a small proportion of the species' standing biomass may not be precautionary for their predators.},

Here we describe and quantify the importance of fishing activities as well as sea-ice cover and other environmental variables to the distribution patterns of birds and seals. The most striking aspect of the winter avifauna was its pronounced concentration near fishing trawlers operating on the continental shelf to the north and west of Elephant Island, and its temporal shift in response to the seasonal advance of the ice edge.},

  abstract = {The recovery of whale populations from centuries of exploitation will have important management and ecological implications due to greater exposure to anthropogenic activities and increasing prey consumption. Here, a Bayesian population model integrates catch data, estimates of abundance, and information on genetics and biology to assess the recovery of western South Atlantic (WSA) humpback whales (               Megaptera novaeangliae               ). Modelling scenarios evaluated the sensitivity of model outputs resulting from the use of different data, different model assumptions and uncertainty in catch allocation and in accounting for whales killed but not landed. A long period of exploitation drove WSA humpback whales to the brink of extinction. They declined from nearly 27 000 (95\% PI = 22 800--33 000) individuals in 1830 to only 450 (95\% PI = 200--1400) whales in the mid-1950s. Protection led to a strong recovery and the current population is estimated to be at 93\% (95\% PI = 73--100\%) of its pre-exploitation size. The recovery of WSA humpback whales may result in large removals of their primary prey, the Antarctic krill (               Euphausia superba               ), and has the potential to modify the community structure in their feeding grounds. Continued monitoring is needed to understand how these whales will respond to modern threats and to climate-driven changes to their habitats.},
